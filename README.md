# Video Walkthrough

Here's a video walkthrough of the Rights Management Portal (milestone-1) that showcases how a user can create a contract and retrieve it by going to "My Contracts" section -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drf5ZIQuo84 

# Cache Engine Dependency

Rights Management Portal has a dependency on PolkaMusic Cache Engine which caches all the information in the CRM pallet and stores it in a MySQL database which is used to access data quickly through simple or complex MySQL queries. While the source of truth is the blockchain, the cache engine database allows us to retrieve data with more efficiency than the ledger. The source code is located at -> https://github.com/polkamusic/PolkaMusic-Core/tree/main/cache-engine

# IPFS - Pinata

Rights Management Portal saves the following files to IPFS via Pinata.
1) The music mp3/wav file
2) The cover art image
3) The meta data csv file 

All the meta deta entered by the user such as song name, artist name etc is packaged into csv and pinned on IPFS via Pinata. The hash of the above files are stored on the blockchain at the time of new contract creation.

# Getting Started with PolkaMusic RMP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
